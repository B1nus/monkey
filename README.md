# monkey
My implementation of the monkey programming language. I'm following the book [Writing an interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).

# Usage
clone this repository `$ git clone https://github.com/B1nus/monkey` and start the [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) using [go](https://go.dev/) `$ go run main.go`. You can run files by adding the file path `$ go run main.go samples/map`.
